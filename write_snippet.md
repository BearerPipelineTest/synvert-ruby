title: Write Snippet
---

We define snippets and tests [here][1], they are good
examples.

We encourage developers to create their own snippets and send pull
request to us. There are several rules you should follow to create your
own snippets.

1. use a unique name, and write description to explain what the snippet
   does.
2. add comments to explain what each instance does, e.g.
   `# Factory.create(:post) => create(:post)`
3. test snippet, see our example [here][2].

If you don't want to write the snippet by yourself, feel free to [open
an issue][3] to us, we can help you write it.
