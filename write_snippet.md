title: Write Snippet
---

We encourage developers to create their own snippets and send pull
request to us. There are several rules you should follow to create your
own snippets.

1. use a unique name, and write description to explain what the snippet
   does.
2. add comments to explain what each instance does, e.g.
   `# Factory.create(:post) => create(:post)`
3. test snippet, see our example [here][1].

If you don't want to write the snippet by yourself, feel free to [open
an issue][2] to us, we can help you write it.
